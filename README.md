# Hotspot UX Challange
How to install and run your project

Please clone the repository and open index.html using any browser. No need to use any tools to run the application
2. What design choices you made, and why?

As search functionality is the heart for the application, made search as the major showcase. 
Features that are implemented.
 Based on user location hot spots will show-up. 
 Single page auto search 
 Used exiting API to extract the hotspots.   Also with considering timeframe given to me in mind, I’ve implemented slick layout without using any illustrations or graphics. 
   Areas need to be improved. 
Showcasing only 2 rows of data and opening the rest by clicking on load all results button.
Map view implementation
Adding some illustrations to banner.

3 If you had the option, what frame/libraries work you would use and not use, and why

Since it is less time duration, used jQuey to make Ajax calls. And also used Google API to get the zip code based on current location. HTML5 and CSS3 for frontend design.

# Hotspot


I am writing to formally announce my resignation from my position at BMO, effective today, 04/17/2024. This was not an easy decision to make, and it comes after careful consideration and the acceptance of an opportunity that will further my career growth and development.

As we have worked closely together, I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will do everything in my power to hand over my responsibilities effectively. Please let me know the steps I should follow during the notice period.

Additionally, could you please confirm my last working day? I need to update my vendor and ensure all affairs are in order for a seamless transition.

I look forward to staying in touch, and I hope to cross paths again in the future. Thank you for your support and understanding.
