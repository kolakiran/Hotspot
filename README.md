Features that are implemented.
 Based on user location hot spots will show-up. 
 Single page auto search 
 Used exiting API to extract the hotspots.   Also with considering timeframe given to me in mind, I’ve implemented slick layout without using any illustrations or graphics. 
   Areas need to be improved. 
Showcasing only 2 rows of data and opening the rest by clicking on load all results button.
Map view implementation
Adding some illustrations to banner.

3 If you had the option, what frame/libraries work you would use and not use, and why

Since it is less time duration, used jQuey to make Ajax calls. And also used Google API to get the zip code based on current location. HTML5 and CSS3 for frontend design.

# Hotspot

We are in the process of enabling observability for the WROS-Kafka topics. During our work, we've discovered an absence of data across all topics within the lower environment. It appears necessary to restart the Dynatrace One agent on the specified servers to address this issue.

Should you require additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out. @ccc, kindly supplement with any additional required steps as you see fit.
